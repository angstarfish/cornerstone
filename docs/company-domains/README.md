# Using a Custom Domain for your Company

In order to get your domain to resolve to the application, you will gave to create a cname
in your domain provider's register pointing to `$APP_DOMAIN`.

For `https` protocol you may use a [cloudflare proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/get-started/). Alternatively, if you would like to have an ssl certificate installed on our servers, please [contact us](mailto:info@$APP_DOMAIN) for a free quote.
